# dot-net-iot-project

I will be using this project to gain fimiliarity with C# and other dot net things as it relates to cloud

!!! CREATE A DOCKER HEALTH CHECK USING C# !!!
If time is available then do some thing with playwright

I will be using playwright here, I'll do come automation stuff with it I guess, maybe even create a bot
Or I could do some kind of api testing with playwright, I'll see if that is the best course of action for this project
