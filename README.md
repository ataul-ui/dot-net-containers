# dot-net-iot-project

I will be using this project to gain fimiliarity with C# and other dot net things as it relates to cloud

quick test

Yeah do something with c# and playwright in this, absolutely forget about golang tbh, it sucks and I have no idea where to use golang

!!! CREATE A DOCKER HEALTH CHECK USING C#, and use github actions to do CI/CD and c# and JUST USE THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE CONTAINER I USED BEFORE AS TESTING!!!
follow this tutorial:

HONESTLY, THIS SHOULD JUST BE AN ADD ON FOR CLOUD PROJECT INSTEAD OF
ITS OWN THING

In that case producer will be .net written in c# and consumer will be written in golang

Or it can be the other way around, consumer will be .net written in c# and producer will be written in golang






follow this tutorial too if needed: https://medium.com/geekculture/integration-test-with-docker-and-net6-564cb4922cfd 

also do it with test containers dot net : https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet 

Huh this could be a TEST CONTAINERS + .NET + GITHUB ACTIONS PROJECT

so the process is: .net integration test is written and will be deployed inside of testcontainer which will be created through github actions during a git push

esentially replicate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLwZ3Cdt9Vs (wriiten documentation here: https://testcontainers.com/guides/testing-an-aspnet-core-web-app/)


If time is available then do some thing with playwright
If i do use playwright, then I can create a simple playwright script that gets the website data in puts them in the postgresql database. Pretty good plan tbh. I'm gonna execute this going forward. Playwright can go on the data engineering extern on resume, and c# testing can go on the novo project on basic resume

I will be using playwright here, I'll do come automation stuff with it I guess, maybe even create a bot
Or I could do some kind of api testing with playwright, I'll see if that is the best course of action for this project
