# dot-net-iot-project

I will be using this project to gain fimiliarity with C# and other dot net things as it relates to cloud

!!! CREATE A DOCKER HEALTH CHECK USING C#, and use github actions to do CI/CD and c# and JUST USE THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE CONTAINER I USED BEFORE AS TESTING!!!
follow this tutorial:

honestly just follow whtat that tutorial said, don't bother using my own postgres database from novo project
^^ his source code is behind a paywall
follow this tutorial instead: https://medium.com/geekculture/integration-test-with-docker-and-net6-564cb4922cfd 

also do it with test containers dot net : https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet 

Huh this could be a TEST CONTAINERS + .NET + GITHUB ACTIONS PROJECT


If time is available then do some thing with playwright
If i do use playwright, then I can create a simple playwright script that gets the website data in puts them in the postgresql database. Pretty good plan tbh. I'm gonna execute this going forward. Playwright can go on the data engineering extern on resume, and c# testing can go on the novo project on basic resume

I will be using playwright here, I'll do come automation stuff with it I guess, maybe even create a bot
Or I could do some kind of api testing with playwright, I'll see if that is the best course of action for this project
